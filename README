This script will read log entries generated by iptables from the any arguments passed to
the script or stdin and summarize any outbound traffic by port, protocol and interface.

To get iptables to start logging traffic, run the command

    sudo /sbin/iptables -I OUTPUT -m state --state NEW -j LOG

and to disable logging when you are done run

    sudo /sbin/iptables -D OUTPUT -m state --state NEW -j LOG
